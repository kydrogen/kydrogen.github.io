# Economic Blackout of February 28, 2025

During the month of February, many corporations faced criticism for scaling back on DEI programs. The People's Union USA, founded by John Schawrz, organized a boycott. This was a 24 hour boycott that was a direct response to the withdraw of DEI initiatives by major corporations. Participants were urged to abstain from all purchases for a day.

This movement gained significant traction on social media platforms trending nationwide. Because people on social media were spreading this boycott, you might think that this boycott would have somewhat of a significant effect daily fluctuations in shopping activity. Retail analysts such as Marshal Cohen from Circanam, reported no significant decrease in consumer spending on the day of the boycott. He noted that typical daily fluctuations in shopping activity, like those in customer traffic, making it difficult to attribute any changes directly to the boycott.

In the wake of the boycott, several corporations faced an increased scrutiny over their DEI policies. Target, for example, experienced a ten week decline in store traffic following its rollback of DEI initiatives.
