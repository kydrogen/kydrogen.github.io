# Are DEI programs effective?

The effectiveness of DEI initiatives has been a topic of considerable debate. Research highlighting both the shortcomings and the potential improvements. 

## The DEI programs that don't work very well
Only some programs for DEI are showing effectiveness. Mandatory Diversity Training is not one. Making everyone take a required diversity class does not help that much. Studies indicated that mandatory Diversity Training can be ineffective and counterproductive. Research done by Frank Dobbin, a sociology professor at Harvard University, and Alexandra Kalev, a sociology professor at TEL Aviv University conducted an extensive study analyzing data from over 800 US companies for over 31 years, found that mandatory Diversity Training did not lead to an increase in representation of minorities in management positions. In some cases, it even resulted in declines. 

Mandatory or poorly designed diversity training cna sometimes provoke backlash, especially amongst dominant groups. Research has shown that such training can sometimes reinforce negative stereotypes rather than promote inclusive behavior leading to incased resistance among employees. 

## More Effective DEI Approches 
Voluntary Diversity Training, as opposed to the mandatory sessions, tends to be more effective. Employees who choose to partake in these voluntary classes are much more likely to be receptive and integrate their training into their behavior. When people choose to attend Diversity Training, they are more open to learning and applying the content to their behavior. 

Mentoring Programs pair junior employees with senior mentors to help underrepresented groups build skills and get noticed for promotions. Mentoring programs increased representation of Black, Hispanic, and Asian American women and men in management by 9 to 24%, according to Dobbin and Kalev's studies.
