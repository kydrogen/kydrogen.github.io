# Are DEI programs effective?

The effectiveness of DEI initiatives has been a topic of considerable debate. Research highlighting both the shortcomings and the potential improvements. 

## The DEI programs that don't work very well
Only some programs for DEI are showing effectiveness. Mandatory Diversity Training is not one. Making everyone take a required diversity class does not help that much. Studies indicated that mandatory Diversity Training can be ineffective and counterproductive. Research done by Frank Dobbin, a socioology professor at Harvard University, and Alexandra Kalev, a sociology professor at TEL Aviv University conducted an extensive study analyzing data from over 800 US companies for over 31 years, found that mandatory Diversity Training did not lead to an increase in representation of minorities in management positions. In some cases, it even resulted in declines. 

Mandatary or poorly desinged diversity training cna sometimes provoke backlash, especially amongst dominant groups. Resaerch has shown that such training can sometimes reingforce negative stereotypes rather than promote inclusive behavoir leading to incrased resistance among employees. 

## More Effective DEI Approches 
Voluntary Divirsity Training, as oppsed to the mandatory sessions, tends to be more effective. Employees who choose to partake in these voluntary classes are much more likely to be receptive and integrate their training into their behavior. When people choose to attend Diversity Training, they are more open to learning and applying the content to their behavior. 

Mentoring Programs pair junoir employees with senoir mentors to help underrepresented groups build skills and get notived for promotions. Menotoring programs increased represntation of Black, Hispanic, and Asian American women and men in mangement by 9 to 24%, according to Dobbin and Kalev's studies.
