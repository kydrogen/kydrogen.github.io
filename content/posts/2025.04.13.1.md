This is a special DEI blog series where I will explore what DEI is and provide unbiased information regarding many topics of DEI.

# What is DEI?

DEI is an acronym. It stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Diversity means to have variety. In this case, however, it could mean having different people, races, genders, ages, religions, abilities or backgrounds. Equity means to be fair or equitable. Equity does not mean treating everyone the same way but it means providing the same opportunities for people. It means to recognizing that some people might face more obstacles than others and adjusting policies to support and help level the playing field. Inclusion in DEI means to make sure that people feel like they belong. Like they feel equally valued.
