In this case however, it could mean having diffrent people, races, genders, ages, religions, abilites or backrounds. Equity means to be fair or equitable. Equity does not mean treating everyone the same way but it means providing the same opertunites for people. It means to recognize that some people might face more obstacles than others and adjusting policers to support to help level the playing field.
