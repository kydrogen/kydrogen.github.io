# Harvard Faces Federal Sanctions Over Refusing To End DEI Programs

Recently, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order stating that all federally funded educational institutions including Harvard, eliminate DEI initiatives. In April of 2025, the Trump administration froze about $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard. This is due to Harvard declining to dismantle their DEI initiatives. 

Not only did the Trump administration freeze funding, but also threaten to revoke Harvard's tax exempt status, but also prohibit the university from enrolling international students. These measures aim to pressure Harvard into discarding DEI programs. 

These freezes on funding has a huge impact on research. It has jeopardized numerous research projects at Harvard. For instance, scientists working on tuberculosis research involving macaques have warned that without funding, they may be forced to put down animals due to their inability to care for them.

Other university or academic institutions just like Harvard receive millions of dollars in federal research grants. All for medicine, engineering, public health and more. If the government starts auditing these academic institutions too, their funding could be cut. Stalling or even canceling important research projects.
