notes

In the 1980s, Lewis Brown Griggs was credited for coining the terms diversity and equity. He alone did not found DEI but multiple people did. The modern DEI movment is rooted from the US Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.  Lewis Brown contributed to the terminology of DEI and early corporate training efforts. At first, DEI primarly focused on just racial disparites. Overtime, DEI expanded and grew to encompass many other aspects such as gender identity, disability, reliion and belif, language and national origin, socioenconomic status and much more.
